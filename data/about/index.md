Hello! I'm Daisy Macharia, a Kenyan-bred software engineer.

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to build products that provide a good performant experiences.

Shortly after graduating from [Multimedia University of Kenya](https://www.mmu.ac.ke/), I joined a fast growing African tech startup, as a software engineer.
